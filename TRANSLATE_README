intltool-extract --local --type=gettext/glade ui/coverart_search_providers_prefs.ui

#create a new template file called po/package.pot by running below

# Section 2: Translators
#+++++++++++++++++++++++

The best way to create translations is to visit our Launchpad site

 - https://translations.launchpad.net/coverartbrowser

Set your preferred language and then just begin translating

If you dont want to use Launchpad, use the following instructions

# Carry out the following - one or the other (or both!)
#create a new locale file from this template:
cd po; msginit --no-translator

#create a new specific (e.g. spanish) locale file from this template:
cd po; msginit --no-translator -l es

#Take special care with "Fuzzy" translations.  "Fuzzy" lines should be
#removed - the string should be carefully examined since these are often
#automated translations.

#run lang.sh to compile and install the po files
sudo ./lang.sh /usr/share/locale/
